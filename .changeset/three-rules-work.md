**BREAKING**: Bump minimum supported Angular version to v12. If your application is on Angular 11 or before, please migrate to Angular 12 as per [official guide](https://update.angular.io/?v=11.0-12.0).

*Note*: Going forward, `@aws-amplify/ui-angular` will have the same version support as Angular's official LTS [support window](https://angular.io/guide/releases#actively-supported-versions). This means all major versions will be supported for 18 months, until we bump to the next major version.
