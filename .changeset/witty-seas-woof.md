**Breaking**: We replaced following legacy Authenticator texts:
- `Send Code` in reset password screen is replaced by `Send code`.
- `Forgot your password? ` with the trailing space is replaced by `Forgot your password`.

If you were using `I18n` to translate those keys, please update your translations accordingly to match the new strings.
