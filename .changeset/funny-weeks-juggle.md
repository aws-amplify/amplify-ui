fix: removes 500 status code sent upon websocket connection timeout and adds CONNECTION_TIMEOUT event.

A websocket connection timeout will now return the error state `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` with message `Websocket connection timeout`. This also updates the `displayText` to include `connectionTimeoutHeaderText` and `connectionTimeoutMessageText` for displaying the error in the UI.
