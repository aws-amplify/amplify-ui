# Description: this workflow publishes UI packages to `latest` tag on NPM.

# Triggered by: whenever "Version Packages" is merged

# If successful, we will publish all updated UI packages to

#   - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-amplify/ui-react
#   - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-amplify/ui-vue

      #       In either way, we'll attempt to publish the packages. In case of (1), publish will succeed. In
