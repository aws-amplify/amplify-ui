- Making tab active border overlap the ribbon border. This is typically how active border indicators work
- Made the chevron for expanding the ribbon on mobile smaller. The icon is so much bigger than other icons.
- Changed the active color of the tab the default brand color of amplify UI.
- Made the border color work with dark mode too

- Using theme values for spacing and font sizes (this will help )
- The horizontal padding of the global header changing from 18px to 20px when going to smaller screen size is weird because it is so similar. Using the theme values for spacing would help. It would be hard for each site to line up with these minor changes.

- The 'Learn' title in the secondary nav for the Learn site doesn't really look like a title. It is too similar to the font size and color of the links.
- The Learn site completely loses its navigation on smaller screens, which doesn't seem right?
