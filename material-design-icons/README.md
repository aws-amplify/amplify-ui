## Getting Started

Read the [developer guide](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) on how to use the material design icons in your project.

### Using a font

The `font` folder contains pre-generated font files that can be included in a project. This is especially convenient for the web; however, it is generally better to link to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Icons"
      rel="stylesheet">
```
