# Options:
#  -r (region): AWS region to pull environments from. Defaults to us-east-2.
#  -i (include): Regex pattern that matches environment folders to pull from.
#  -e (exclude): Regex pattern that matches environment folders to ignore.
# If both -i and -e are specified, it'll match all dirs that match -i but not -e.

# Examples:
# - Include only sms/phone environments:
#   ./pull-environments.sh -r us-east-2 -i "\./auth/auth-with-((phone-and-sms-mfa)|(phone-number)|(totp-and-sms-mfa))"
