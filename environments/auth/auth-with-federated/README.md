# Auth with Federated

This backend is configured with Amplify Admin UI:

- Authentication
  - `Email` is a required attribute, if not using a social provider to sign in
  - `Amazon`, `Facebook`, and `Google` are all supported to sign in with
  - No screenshots are included as they contain secret IDs for the web apps

## Using this Backend

External contributors can re-create this backend by running:

```shell
amplify init
```
