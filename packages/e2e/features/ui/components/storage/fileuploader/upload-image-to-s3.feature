    Given I intercept '{ "method": "PUT", "url": "**/test.jpg?partNumber**"  }' with fixture "FileUploader-upload-part.xml" and add header "Etag" with value "&quot;abc123&quot;"
    Given I intercept '{ "method": "POST", "url": "**/test.jpg?uploadId**"  }' with fixture "FileUploader-uploads-complete.xml"
    Given I intercept '{ "method": "GET", "url": "**/?list-type=2**"  }' with fixture "FileUploader-uploads-list.xml"
