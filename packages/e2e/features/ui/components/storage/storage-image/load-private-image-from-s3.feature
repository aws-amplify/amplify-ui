  Scenario: I successfully load a private image
    When I type my "email" with status "CONFIRMED"
    Then I type my password
    Then I click the "Sign in" button
    Then I see "Loader1" element
    Then I see "Loader2" element
    Then I see the "private cat 1" image    
    Then I see the "private cat 2" image
    Then I see "The first private image is loaded."
    Then I see "The second private image is loaded."
    Then I see "Sign out"
