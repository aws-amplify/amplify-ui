Feature: Sign In with Phone Number

  Amplify's SignIn component uses AWS Cognito's authentication
  service to provide a sign in experience to your application's
  users.

  Amplify can be configured to allow a user to use their phone
  number when signing into your application.

  Background:

  @angular @react @vue
  Scenario: Phone number field autocompletes username
  
  On sign in form, autocomplete prefers usage of username instead of phone number.

    Then "Phone Number" field autocompletes "username"

  @angular @react @vue
  Scenario: Password fields autocomplete "new-password"
    Then "Password" field autocompletes "current-password"
