Feature: Sign Up with Email

  Create a new user in the Amazon Cognito UserPool by passing the new userâ€™s email address and password.

  Background:
    Given I'm running the example "ui/components/authenticator/sign-up-with-email"
    And I click the Create Account tab

  @todo-angular @react @todo-vue
  Scenario: Login mechanism set to "email"
    Then I see "Email" as an input field
    And I don't see "Username" as an input field
    And I don't see "Phone Number" as an input field

  @angular @react @vue @todo-angular  @todo-vue
  Scenario: Sign up with a new email & password
    When I type a new "email"
    And I type my password
    And I confirm my password
    And I click the "Create Account" button
    Then I see "Confirmation Code"

  @todo-angular @react @todo-vue
  Scenario: Email field autocompletes username

  On sign up form, autocomplete prefers usage of username instead of email.
