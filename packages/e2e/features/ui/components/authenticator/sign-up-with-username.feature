  Scenario: Login mechanism set to "username"
    Then I see "Username" as an input field
    And I see "Email" as an input field

    When I type my "username" with status "UNCONFIRMED"
    And I type my password
    And I confirm my password
    And I type my "email" with status "UNCONFIRMED"
    And I type my "phone number" with status "UNCONFIRMED"
    And I click the "Create Account" button
    Then I see "Confirm Sign Up"
