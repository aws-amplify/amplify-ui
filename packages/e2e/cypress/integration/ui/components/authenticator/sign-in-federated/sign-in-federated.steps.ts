/**
 * This test file is super sparse, but I cannot get it to do anything
 * once I click on the "Sign in" button without failing. Intercepting
 * any calls doesn't work either. Or, rather, I can intercept the calls,
 * but it doesn't prevent the test from failing due to Cypress timing
 * out on a page redirect.
 *
 * Going to leave this sparse for now and see if I can get our new
 * implementation to work a little bit nicer. Will include a GIF of
 * manual verification that the feature works in the PR.
