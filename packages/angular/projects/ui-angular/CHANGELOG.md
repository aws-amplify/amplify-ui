  The `Authenticator` has been updated based on customer feedback & real-world use-cases to deliver an improved out-of-the-box experience & greater customization.

  _See: [RFC: Authenticator@next](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/discussions/200)_

  ## Goals

  - **Zero-config** – The Authenticator automatically infers Amplify CLI & Admin UI settings to work out-of-the-box.

    Run `amplify pull` with the latest CLI whenever your backend changes, and the Authenticator automatically reflects the correct login mechanism, social providers, & more.

  - **Native** – The Authenticator is implemented in its respective framework (e.g. Angular, React, Vue) for consistency & familiarity.

  - **Stable** – Existing & upcoming Authenticator behavior is captured & tested to reduce & prevent regressions.

    [Authenticator behavior](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/tree/main/packages/e2e/features/ui/components/authenticator) is tested as [E2E tests](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#e2e-testing) on every PR.

  - **Interoperable** – Work with password managers, autofill, existing styles, & other common features.

  - **Customizable** – More ways to customize the UI & behavior without losing the benefits of the Authenticator.

    Customers have access to the same functionality that the `Authenticator` uses internally to even build a 100% custom Authenticator, without sacrificing any of the logic.

  - **Reproducible** – Authentication is complex. The Authenticator is is developed & tested against a myriad of Amplify backends, example apps, and specifications.

    Check out our [environments](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/tree/main/environments) and [examples](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/tree/main/examples) for more.

### Minor Changes

- [#626](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/pull/626) [`f84e9949b`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/commit/f84e9949bd98b20fe8d1dff85e30ae69f2356351) Thanks [@ericclemmons](https://github.com/ericclemmons)! - ## Zero Configuration

  As of `@aws-amplify/cli@6.5.0`, `aws-exports.js` includes your backend configuration for the Authenticator to automatically infer `loginMechanisms` and `socialProviders`.

  ### Before (React)

  ```js
  export default withAuthenticator(App, {
    loginMechanisms: ['email'],
    socialProviders: ['amazon', 'apple', 'facebook', 'google'],
  });
  ```

  ### After (React)

  ```js
  export default withAuthenticator(App);
  ```

  ## Sign in with Apple

  The Authenticator supports `apple` as one of many `socialProviders`. See: https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/social/q/platform/js/

- [#610](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/pull/610) [`1fc955c4e`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/commit/1fc955c4e32a2868fa85078befa2f7e2fe95b5a1) Thanks [@wlee221](https://github.com/wlee221)! - Add `sign-up-form-field` slot and component

- [#627](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/pull/627) [`bd3e09a09`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/commit/bd3e09a09988af5fa803fa97a25956ea7e9144f7) Thanks [@wlee221](https://github.com/wlee221)! - This implements `AuthenticatorService` that can be used internally and externally to access common Authenticator context and helpers.

  _Usage_:

  _app.component.ts_

  ```ts
  export class AppComponent {
    constructor(public authenticator: AuthenticatorService) {}
  }
  ```

  _app.component.html_

  ```html
  <!-- example of "reset password" button -->
  <button (click)="authenticator.toResetPassword()">Reset password</button>

  <!-- example of "sign up" submit button -->
  <button (click)="authenticator.submitForm()">Sign Up</button>

  <!-- disabling the submit button if submission is in progress -->
  <button
    (click)="authenticator.submitForm()"
    [disabled]="authenticator.isPending"
  >
    Sign Up
  </button>
  ```
