# Amplify UI

1. Connected components, like Authenticator, that encapsulate complex cloud-connected workflows.
2. Primitive components, like Buttons and Badges, that create consistency across Amplify UI and allow you to build complete applications that fit your brand.
3. Data bound components, like Collections, that make it easy to display sets of data by querying DataStore.
4. Theming capabilities to customize the appearance of Amplify UI.

This is a very early preview and a work-in-progress

## Features

**Customizable and extensible**

Amplify UI takes the approach of layered customizations so that you never reach a point to have to eject completely. The default Amplify UI is accessible and looks great on any device - use it to get started and build an awesome interface. You can then tweak a few broad theming options to change the overall look-and-feel of your application. Customize every detail of each component, extend them to add functionality, and even replace some components with your own if you want to. We donâ€™t want to get in your way, but instead empower you with a great foundation and default implementation that you can make your own. Amplify UI is built on the idea of loosely coupled parts that work great on their own, but work better together. You can use Amplify UI primitive components without using connected components or Amplify libraries, you can use connected components with your own set of primitives, and everything in-between.

**Accessible and usable by default**

Amplify UI components work on screen readers and follow industry standards and best practices. (e.g WCAG 2.1AA for Web, Apple HIG for iOS). The default UI will be generic enough to fit into most applications, polished enough to not require immediate replacement. Many people did not like the look of the existing Amplify UI components and certain elements did not meet accessibility guidelines like color contrast.

**Respectful to the platform and framework**

We want to share as much as possible between platforms and frameworks, but we also want to respect their identities and rules when possible (e.g following name conventions and language patterns). We are spending a lot of time crafting the developer experience in each platform and framework so that Amplify UI is familiar and consistent with common, best-practices. This is why we are building the components in each framework and platformâ€”to give you the best experience building applications in the framework of your choice.

**Minimal footprint**

Good components are fast and use native styling systems when possible, adding less dependencies, smaller memory footprint, and minimizing side effects. On the web, Amplify UI uses CSS as the base styling implementation, but if you want to use a CSS-in-JS framework or some other means of styling like Tailwind, you can do that! For more information, check out our theming documentation[link]

## Getting started

Install a `@aws-amplify/ui-[framework]` npm module with the `@preview` tag to get the developer preview of the next version of Amplify UI, where [framework] is â€˜reactâ€™, â€˜angularâ€™, or â€˜vueâ€™.

```shell
$ npm install @aws-amplify/ui-react@preview
```

Current available packages with the new Amplify UI:

- @aws-amplify/ui-react (Authenticator and primitives)
- @aws-amplify/ui-angular (Authenticator only right now)
- @aws-amplify/ui-vue (Authenticator only right now)

We will be publishing regular updates to these packages under the `@preview` tag as we go. Bug fixes to the existing stable release of the ui packages will happen on the [aws-amplify/amplify-js](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js) repository.

## Usage

### React

```js
import { Authenticator, useAuth, Button, Heading } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

export default function App() {
  const { state, user, signOut } = useAuth();

  if (state !== 'authenticated') {
    return <Authenticator />;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <Heading level={1}>Welcome {user.username}!</Heading>
      <Button variation="primary" onClick={signOut}>
        Sign Out
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Vue

```js
<authenticator>
  <template v-slot="{ user }">
  <h1 class="text-6xl mb-10">Welcome {{ user.username }}!</h1>
  <button
    className="px-2 bg-white rounded shadow"
    @click="send('SIGN_OUT')"
  >
    Sign Out
  </button>
  </template>
</authenticator>
```

### Angular

```html
<amplify-authenticator>
  <ng-template let-user="user"> Welcome, {{ user.username }}! </ng-template>
</amplify-authenticator>
```

## Documentation

While this is still in a technical preview state, you can find the documentation for the new version of Amplify UI here: [ui.docs.amplify.aws](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws). Once this is ready for a GA release, the docs will live at the canonical documentation site: [docs.amplify.aws/ui/](https://docs.amplify.aws/ui)

Improving our documentation and providing better and more interactive sample code is one of the focuses of the new Amplify UI. We also wanted to make it easier to keep our docs in sync with the UI code so now this repository will have both documentation, UI code, and end-to-end tests to ensure the correctness of the docs.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why are you doing this?**

We looked at the overall trends with the issues people were having with the current Amplify UI

Respect the platform

**Aside from the Authenticator, what can I do with this?**

You can create entire front-end applications including UI! To provide a better default experience building UIs with Amplify UI and to make our connected components more integrated we are building primitive components like Buttons, Badges, and Cards. These primitive components will be used in the connected components like Authenticator, plus you can theme them and use them to build your UI. Currently primitives are only available for React.

**How does this compare to other UI libraries like Tailwind, Chakra, Supabase, or Material-UI?**

Our aim with Amplify UI is to respect the platform and framework

We are taking heavy inspiration from many open source frameworks like Chakra, Radix, Adobe Spectrum, and others. In fact, one of the core ideas with the new Amplify UI is the ability to integrate seamlessly into _any_ application. For example, you can use Tailwind or Chakra with Amplify UI! We don't want to replace any of these great open source UI libraries,

**What is the plan for the amplify-js repository?**

As we continue to work on the new Amplify UI we will move UI-related issues in the amplify-js repository over here to work on them. The eventual end-state would be to keep the platform-based library packages and repositories as-is (amplify-js, amplify-ios, amplify-android, amplify-flutter) and have amplify-ui be the home for Amplify UI components. We will continue to maintain major bug and security fixes for all existing UI packages.

## Contributing

Right now the best way to contribute is to try out the new Amplify UI and give us feedback. We want to make sure we are building the right tools for you to build amazing applications easily.
