The `Authenticator`'s UI is powered by a state machine. You can use the `useAuth`composable
to get access to it and customizing behavior or your own UI:

```html
<template>
  <div v-if="state.matches('authenticated')">
    <h1>Welcome, {user.username}</h1>
    <button onClick="{signOut}">Sign out</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  import { useAuth } from "@aws-amplify/ui-vue";

  ...

  const { signOut, state, user } = useAuth();
</script>
```
