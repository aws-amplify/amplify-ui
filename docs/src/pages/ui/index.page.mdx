title: Amplify UI Components
---

Amplify UI is an open-source design system with cloud-connected workflows and components that make it easy to build accessible, performant, and beautiful applications on multiple frameworks. Amplify UI consists of:

1. Connected components, like Authenticator, that encapsulate complex cloud-connected workflows.
2. Primitive components, like Buttons and Badges, that create consistency across Amplify UI and allow you to build complete applications that fit your brand.
3. Data bound components, like Collections, that make it easy to display sets of data by querying DataStore.
4. Theming capabilities to customize the appearance of Amplify UI.

This is a very early preview and a work-in-progress for the upcoming version of Amplify UI. This next version of these UI packages are not published yet. When they are ready for testing they will be published under the `@next` npm tag. The current versions of the packages are listed below.
