Amplify UI 2.0 is an open-source UI library with cloud-connected components that are endlessly customizable, accessible, and can integrate into any application. Amplify UI consists of:

1. Connected components that simplify complex cloud-connected workflows, like Authenticator.
2. Primitive components that create consistency across Amplify UI and allow you to build complete applications that fit your brand, like Buttons and Badges.
3. Data-bound components that make it easy to display dynamic data, like DataStoreCollections.
4. Theming capabilities that allow you to customize the appearance of Amplify UI to match your brand.

This is a very early preview and a work-in-progress for the upcoming version of Amplify UI.The current versions of the packages are listed below.
