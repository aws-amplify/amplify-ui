The `PhoneNumberField` form primitive can be used allow users to input a phone number.

## Demo

<PhoneNumberFieldDemo />

## Usage

### Autocomplete - supporting password managers

Password managers in Chromium expect input forms to have an `autocomplete` attribute of `username`. As a result, this attribute is
added to the `PhoneNumberField` primitive so that password managers are supported out of the box in Chromium. However, you may pass in
your own `autocomplete` attribute if you wish to override the default value.

## Styling

The `PhoneNumberField` uses the same styling rules as the `TextField` primitive. Refer to the [TextField primitive documentation](textfield#css-styling)
for more information regarding custom styling.
