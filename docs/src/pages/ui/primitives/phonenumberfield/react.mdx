## Demo

## Usage

### Autocomplete - supporting password managers

Password managers in Chromium expect input forms to have an `autocomplete` attribute of `username`. As a result, this attribute is
added to the `PhoneNumberField` primitive so that password managers are supported out of the box in Chromium. However, you may pass in
your own `autocomplete` attribute if you wish to override the default value.

See https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/form-styles-that-chromium-understands for more information.

### Additional Usage

`PhoneNumberField` is a custom primitive built on top of the `TextField` primitive. Refer to the [TextField primitive documentation](textfield#usage)
for more information regarding additional usage.

## Styling

The `PhoneNumberField` uses the same styling rules as the `TextField` primitive. Refer to the [TextField primitive documentation](textfield#css-styling)
for more information regarding custom styling.
