You must wrap your application in `<AmplifyProvider/>`. This is required in order to generate unique Id's for this primitive.

```jsx
import { AmplifyProvider } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
// Step 1: Wrap your APP with `AmplifyProvider`
const App = (
  <AmplifyProvider>
    <MyApp>{/** render primitive here */}</MyApp>
  </AmplifyProvider>
);
```
