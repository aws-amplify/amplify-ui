import { Card, View, Flex, Text } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import { CardSample } from './demo.tsx';

The Card component can be used to group related pieces of content. The card component renders as a `div` by default but can be changed with the **as** prop.

## Installation

```
npm install @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

## Usage

A card component will include basic styling but the form of the card component will come from the content passed into it.

```jsx
<Card maxWidth="20rem">
  <Image
    src="/road-to-milford-new-zealand-800w.jpg"
    alt="Glittering stream with old log, snowy mountain peaks
    tower over a green field."
    objectFit="cover"
  />
  <View padding="1rem">
    <Flex>
      <Badge backgroundColor="lightgreen">Plus</Badge>
      <Badge backgroundColor="lightblue">Verified</Badge>
    </Flex>
    <Divider padding="1rem 0 0 0" />
    <Heading level={3}>
      <b>New Zealand White Water Outdoor Adventure</b>
    </Heading>
    <View padding="0 1rem">
      <Text padding="0 0 1rem 0" isTruncated={true}>
        Join us on this beautiful outdoor adventure through the glittering
        rivers through the snowy peaks on New Zealand.
      </Text>
      <Button isFullWidth={true}>Book it</Button>
    </View>
  </View>
</Card>
```

<CardSample />

### Set rendered HTML element

Change the HTML element rendered by Card with the `as` property

```jsx
<Card as="section">I'm a Section</Card>
```

<Card as="section">I'm a Section</Card>

## CSS Styling

There are 3 ways to style a card component. The first is by using styling props on the component itself. The second is by setting or overriding global card styling. The third is by setting local card styling on an individual card.

### Override Amplify styling using props

Use style props to style an instance of `<Card>`

```jsx
<Card color="red">
  <Text>Sample Card</Text>
</Card>
```

<Card color="red">
  <Text>Sample Card</Text>
</Card>

### Global card styling through variables and card class

set css variables or use the built in card class to set global card styling

```css
/* styles.css */
:root {
  --amplify-components-card-border: 3px solid red;
}
/* OR */
.amplify-card {
  border: 3px solid red;
}
```

<Card className="amplify-ui-card-thick-border"> Thick Bordered Card </Card>

### Local card styling with custom css class

```css
/* styles.css */
.custom-card-class {
  border: 3px solid red;
}
```

```jsx
<Card className="custom-card-class">Styled through custom class name</Card>
```

<Card className="custom-card-class">Styled through custom class name</Card>
