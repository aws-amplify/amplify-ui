#### Amplify Provider Theme

You can update the style of the Authenticator by using the [AmplifyProvider](/theming?platform=react) [theme object](/theming?platform=react#theme-object). To do this, you must surround the `Authenticator` in the `AmplifyProvider`.

Then create a [theme object](/theming?platform=react#theme-object), with all your font and color updates. Feel free to use [design tokens](/theming?platform=react#design-tokens), as a way of desiging your theme further.

Below is an example of changing the default colors to a dark theme.

```jsx file=./AuthStyle.tsx

```

<Example>
<AuthStyle />

</Example>

> If you have TypeScript enabled, all the object keys will be present when creating the [theme object](/theming?platform=react#theme-object). This will help speed up your development time while creating themes.
