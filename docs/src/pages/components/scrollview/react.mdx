import { Flex, Image, ScrollView } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

import { ScrollViewDemo } from './demo';
import { Example } from '@/components/Example';

`ScrollView` is essentially a `View` that allows scrolling of its inner contents. See also [View](/ui/primitives/view?platform=react).

## Demo

<ScrollViewDemo />

## Usage

Import the ScrollView component and styles.

```jsx
import { Image, ScrollView } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

<ScrollView height="300px" width="400px">
  <Image
    width="800px"
    maxWidth="800px"
    src="/amplify-logo.svg"
    alt="Amplify-logo"
  />
</ScrollView>;
```

<Example>
  <Flex justifyContent="center">
    <ScrollView height="300px" width="400px">
      <Image
        width="800px"
        maxWidth="800px"
        src="/amplify-logo.svg"
        alt="Amplify-logo"
      />
    </ScrollView>
  </Flex>
</Example>

### Orientation

Specify scroll `orientation` as `horizontal`, `vertical` or none(default). None(default) maps to `overflow: scroll`, while `horizontal` and `vertical` map to `overflow-x: scroll` and `overflow-y: scroll` respectively.

_Notes: In order for overflow to have an effect, the block-level container must have a set height (height or max-height), or other attributes that set the behavior for an element's overflow (e.g. overflow-wrap set to normal, white-space set to nowrap etc.). See [overflow - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow)_

**Default(Horizontal and Vertical)**

```jsx
import { Image, ScrollView } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

<ScrollView height="300px" width="400px">
  <Image
    width="800px"
    maxWidth="800px"
    src="/amplify-logo.svg"
    alt="Amplify-logo"
  />
</ScrollView>;
```

<Example>
  <Flex justifyContent="center">
    <ScrollView height="300px" width="400px">
      <Image
        width="800px"
        maxWidth="800px"
        src="/amplify-logo.svg"
        alt="Amplify-logo"
      />
    </ScrollView>
  </Flex>
</Example>

**Horizontal**

```css
/* style.css */
.horizontal-example {
  overflow-wrap: normal;
}
```

```jsx
import { Image, ScrollView } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

import './style.css';

<ScrollView
  width="200px"
  className="horizontal-example"
  orientation="horizontal"
>
  The value of Pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433832795029. The value of e is
  2.7182818284590452353602874713526625.
</ScrollView>;
```

<Example>
  <ScrollView
    width="200px"
    className="horizontal-example"
    orientation="horizontal"
  >
    {
      'The value of Pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433832795029. The value of e is 2.7182818284590452353602874713526625.'
    }
  </ScrollView>
</Example>

**Vertical**

```jsx
import { Image, ScrollView } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

<ScrollView height="100px" width="200px" orientation="vertical">
  Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn
  Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters
  had but newly retired from the face of the earth.
</ScrollView>;
```

<Example>
  <ScrollView height="100px" width="200px" orientation="vertical">
    {
      "Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth."
    }
  </ScrollView>
</Example>

## CSS Styling

### Local styling

To override styling on a specific View, you can use a class selector or style props.

_Using a class selector:_

```css
/* styles.css */
.my-scrollview {
  height: 100px;
  width: 200px;
  background-color: var(--amplify-colors-blue-40);
}
```

```jsx
import { ScrollView } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

import './styles.css';

<Example>
  <ScrollView className="my-scrollview">
    {
      "Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth."
    }
  </ScrollView>
</Example>;
```

<Example>
  <ScrollView className="my-scrollview">
    {
      "Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth."
    }
  </ScrollView>
</Example>

_Using style props:_

```jsx
import { ScrollView } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

<ScrollView
  height="100px"
  width="200px"
  backgroundColor="var(--amplify-colors-blue-40)"
>
  {
    "Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth."
  }
</ScrollView>;
```

<Example>
  <ScrollView
    height="100px"
    width="200px"
    backgroundColor="var(--amplify-colors-blue-40)"
  >
    {
      "Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth."
    }
  </ScrollView>
</Example>
