The Image primitive can be used to display responsive images.

## Demo

<ImageDemo />

## Usage

Import the `Image` component and styles. Images are responsive by default (if you're on desktop, try resizing your browser window).

```jsx
<Image
  src="/road-to-milford-new-zealand-800w.jpg"
  alt="View from road to Milford Sound, New Zealand.
  Glittering stream with old log, snowy mountain peaks
  tower over a green field."
/>
```

<Image
  src="/road-to-milford-new-zealand-800w.jpg"
  alt="View from road to Milford Sound, New Zealand.
  Glittering stream with old log, snowy mountain peaks
  tower over a green field."
/>

### Responsive Image optimization

Use `sizes` and `srcSet` to dynamically load different Image sizes based on screen size/resolution. For more information, see [MDN responsive images article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

```jsx
<Image
  srcSet="/road-to-milford-new-zealand-800w.jpg 800w,
          /road-to-milford-new-zealand-1200w.jpg 1200w,
          /road-to-milford-new-zealand-1400w.jpg 1400w"
  alt="View from road to Milford Sound, New Zealand.
      Glittering stream with old log, snowy mountain peaks
      tower over a green field."
/>
```

<Image
  srcSet="/road-to-milford-new-zealand-800w.jpg 800w,
          /road-to-milford-new-zealand-1200w.jpg 1200w,
          /road-to-milford-new-zealand-1400w.jpg 1400w"
  alt="View from road to Milford Sound, New Zealand.
      Glittering stream with old log, snowy mountain peaks
      tower over a green field."
/>

### Object fit and object position

To control how an Image fits its container, use the `objectFit` and `objectPosition` properties.

```jsx
<View width="400px" height="400px" boxShadow="8px 6px 6px 0 #ccc">
  <Image
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    objectFit="cover"
    src="/road-to-milford-new-zealand-800w.jpg"
    alt="Glittering stream with old log, snowy mountain peaks
    tower over a green field."
  />

</View>
```

<View width="400px" height="400px" boxShadow="8px 6px 6px 0 #ccc">
  <Image
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    objectFit="cover"
    src="/road-to-milford-new-zealand-800w.jpg"
    alt="Glittering stream with old log, snowy mountain peaks
    tower over a green field."
  />
