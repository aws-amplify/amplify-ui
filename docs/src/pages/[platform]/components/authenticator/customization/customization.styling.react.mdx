### Theme Provider Theme

You can update the style of the Authenticator by using the [ThemeProvider](/react/theming) [theme object](/react/theming#theme-object). To do this, you must surround the `Authenticator` in the `ThemeProvider`.

Then create a [theme object](/react/theming#theme-object), with all your font and color updates. Feel free to use [design tokens](/react/theming#design-tokens), as a way of designing your theme further.

Below is an example of changing the default colors to a dark theme.

```jsx file=./AuthStyle.tsx

```

<Example>
<AuthStyle />

</Example>

> If you have TypeScript enabled, all the object keys will be present when creating the [theme object](/react/theming#theme-object). This will help speed up your development time while creating themes.
