## Unauthenticated Routes

Providing a builder value of `Authenticator.builder()` to your MaterialApp will make all routes in your application require authentication. The Authenticator can also be used to protect a subset of routes, and leave other routes unauthenticated.

In the example below, the default route (route A) will not require authentication. When the app launches, WidgetA will show to authenticated and unauthenticated users. Route B returns an AuthenticatedView widget, with a child of WidgetB. This route will require authentication. If an unauthenticated user navigates to this route, they will see the authenticator. As soon as they authenticate, they will see WidgetB.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Authenticator(
    child: MaterialApp(
      initialRoute: '/routeA',
      routes: {
        '/routeA': (BuildContext context) => const WidgetA(),
        '/routeB': (BuildContext context) {
          return const AuthenticatedView(
            child: WidgetB(),
          );
        },
      },
    ),
  );
}
```
