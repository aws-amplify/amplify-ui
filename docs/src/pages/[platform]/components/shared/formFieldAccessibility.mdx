The form primitives are accessible by default. A matching `label` HTML element will be connected to the form control -- simply provide a `label` prop with a `string` or `ReactNode`. If no `id` is provided, one will be automatically generated and connected to both `label` and form control elements.

#### How can I visually hide the label while maintaining accessibility?

In some applications it may be desirable to hide the label when the field purpose is visually apparent such as a search field with button.
The `labelHidden` prop can be used to visually hide the label while still keeping it visible for screenreaders.

UX Tip: refrain hiding label if doing so hides important information needed by the user to fill out the field.
