Amplify UI components follow [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and 
[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices and guidelines for color contrast, 
keyboard navigation, accessible labels, and focus management. The intent of Amplify UI is to 
provide components that are flexible and can be composed into modern, accessible patterns 
with as few limitations as possible.
