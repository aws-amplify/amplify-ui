Amplify UI components follow [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and 
[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices and guidelines for color contrast, 
keyboard navigation, accessible labels, and focus management. The intent of Amplify UI is to 
provide components that are flexible and can be composed into modern, accessible patterns 
with as few limitations as possible.

## What's included?

Many Amplify UI components ship with accessibility features baked in for ease of use. This includes features 
such as auto-associated labels with form inputs, a default theme with accessible color contrast, the flexibility to 
enhance components to create your own accessible patterns, and more.

###  Accessible form fields
The TextField component allows passing a 'string' to a 'label' prop. The component will take care of creating and associating the `<label>` element with it's corresponding text `<input />`.
