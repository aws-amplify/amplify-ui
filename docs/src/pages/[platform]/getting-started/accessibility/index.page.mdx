Amplify UI components follow [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and 
[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices and guidelines for color contrast, 
keyboard navigation, accessible labels, and focus management. The intent of Amplify UI is to 
provide components that are flexible and can be composed into modern, accessible patterns 
with as few limitations as possible.

## What's included?

Amplify UI components have some accessibility needs baked in for ease of use. This includes auto-associating labels with form inputs, a default theme with accessible color contrast, and the flexibility to 
enhance components to create your own accessible patterns.

###  Accessible form fields

#### Form Labels

All of Amplify UI's form field components allow passing a label to the input. If an ID is not supplied for the component, one is autogenerated for you so that the label can be programatically associated with the input.

#### Web standards

<Grid templateColumns={{ base: '1fr', large: '1fr auto' }} gap="var(--amplify-space-large)">
  <View>Amplify UI also follows web standards as much as possible for our components, including relying on native web controls. For example, our CheckboxField is styled to match our default theme, but still uses an `<input type="checkbox" />` as the base component.</View>
  <View>
    <Text fontWeight="var(--amplify-fontWeights-bold"></Text>
    <CheckboxField label="Example checkbox"/>
  </View>
</Grid>

<Grid margin="var(--amplify-space-large) 0">
 <CardLink 
  href="/react/components/textfield#accessibility--label-behavior"
  title="Accessible input labels"
  desc="Learn about making accessible labels for the TextField component" />
</Grid>
