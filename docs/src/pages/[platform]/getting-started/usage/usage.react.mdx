## React and Amplify UI

Amplify UI is designed to integrate seamlessly with the React framework so you can get started in no time. 

### Installation

If you haven't already, install `@aws-amplify/ui-react` with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

<Tabs>
<TabItem title="npm">

```shell
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem title="yarn">

```shell
yarn add aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Quick start

Here's all you need to get up and running:

<ExampleCode>
```tsx file=./examples/ReactExampleCode.tsx 

```
</ExampleCode>

Copy/paste the code above into your React app, start the app, and look at that lovely Button!

<ReactExampleDemo />

### Components

You can use all of Amplify UI's primitive components (e.g., `Button`, `Tabs`, `Flex`) right out-of-the-box. These are the same components we use to build our connected components such as the [Authenticator](/react/components/authenticator). Please refer to each component's [documentation](/react/components/button) to see how they should be imported, configured and styled.

<Example>
  <ComponentExampleDemo />
  <ExampleCode>
```tsx file=./examples/ComponentExampleCode.tsx

```
  </ExampleCode>
</Example>

### Theming

Amplify UI ships with a default [theme](/react/theming) that you can customize to match the look and feel of your project. Remember to load the default styling by importing our CSS at the entry-point to your application (e.g., `src/App.js`).

```js
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';
```

To learn how to customize the appearance of all components in your application with a theme, see [theming](/react/theming). 

<Example>
  <ThemeExampleDemo />
  <ExampleCode>
```tsx file=./examples/ThemeExampleCode.tsx

```
  </ExampleCode>
</Example>
