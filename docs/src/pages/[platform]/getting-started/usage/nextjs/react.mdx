## Tutorial

In this brief tutorial, we're going to build a basic shopping card component using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and Amplify UI. Then, we'll elaborate on our shopping card to play with the possibilities of using Amplify UI.

### Setup and Installation

First, execute the command below in your terminal. When prompted for the name of your project, enter `amplify-ui-demo`. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem title="npm">
    <TerminalCommand command="npx create-next-app@latest && cd amplify-ui-demo" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem title="yarn">
    <TerminalCommand command="yarn create next-app && cd amplify-ui-demo" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, install the Amplify UI React package:

<InstallScripts framework="react" />

### App Router
Next.js 13.4+ introduced the [App Router `/ app directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-directory) with the usage of [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components). 

Amplify UI components are highly interactive and must be used as Client Components. In order to use Amplify UI components in a Server Component, you need to convert them to Client Components by adding a `'use client'` at the top of your file.

For more info, visit Next.js [third party package documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#third-party-packages).

#### UI Components

To use an Amplify UI component in Server Components, you must re-export them as Client Components.

An example below is shown for using Amplify UI `Button` component:

First, create a Client Component file _AmplifyComponents.jsx_ that re-exports `Button`. Make sure to place `'use client'` at the top of _AmplifyComponents.jsx_ to let Nextjs know that should be handled as a Client Component.

<ExampleCode>

```tsx
// AmplifyComponents.jsx
'use client';

// To allow client-based Amplify components to be rendered inside of React Server Components we need to:

// 1. Import the Amplify components to be used in the application
import { Link } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

// 2. Import the Amplify UI styles
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

// 3. Re-export the Amplify components for use in the application
export { Link };
```

</ExampleCode>

Then, import `Link` from the Client Component and use it anywhere you want, e.g., `app/page.jsx`.

<ExampleCode>

```tsx
// app/page.jsx
import { Link } from './AmplifyComponents';

export default function Home() {
  return <Link href="https://ui.docs.amplify.aws">Hello, Amplify UI!</Link>;
}
```

</ExampleCode>

### Basic Demo

<Alert variation="info" role="none">
Next.js 13.4+ introduces [app directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-directory) with the usage of [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components). To use Amplify UI componenents, you must use them inside the Client Component tree by placing `"use client"` at the boundary between your Client and Server component module graph. Please see the Next.js [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#third-party-packages) on how you could achieve this.

In this guide for Next.js 13.4+, we placed `"use client"` at the top of `page.jsx` for demonstration purposes.

  <TabItem title="Next.js 13.4+">

Open up the project in your IDE and replace the contents of the `app/page.jsx` with the code below:

    <Example>
      <ExampleCode>
      
```tsx file=./examples/UseClientBasicExampleCode.tsx
```

      </ExampleCode>
      <BasicShoppingCard />
    </Example>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem title="Next.js 11.0-13.3">

Open up the project in your IDE and replace the contents of the `pages/index.js` with the code below:

  <Example>
    <ExampleCode>
    
  ```tsx file=./examples/BasicExampleCode.tsx
  ```

    </ExampleCode>
    <BasicShoppingCard />
  </Example>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you start the app (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), you should see a basic shopping card component.

### Advanced Demo

If you’d like to play around with a more comprehensive demo of the Amplify UI library, create a separate file under the `app` folder named `paintings.js`, and copy/paste this code into it:

    <ExampleCode>

```tsx file=./examples/paintings.ts
```

    </ExampleCode>

Then, replace the contents of `app/page.jsx` with the code below, restart the app, and experience all the beautiful components in action!

    <Example>
      <ExampleCode>

```tsx file=./examples/UseClientAdvancedExampleCode.tsx
```

      </ExampleCode>
