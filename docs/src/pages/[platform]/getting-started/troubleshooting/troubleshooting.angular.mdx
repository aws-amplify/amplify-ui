### Global and Process Shim

Angular 6+ does not include shims for `global` or `process`. Follow the instructions below to resolve `global` or `process` reference errors.

<Tabs>
<TabItem title="Angular 15">

First, create `src/polyfills.ts` and add the following:

```ts
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

Then, open your `angular.json` file, and add `src/polyfills.ts` to `polyfills` array(s) in your `angular.json`. These  arrays are located in `projects.<project-name>.architect.<task-name>.options`.

```json{3}
"polyfills": [
  "zone.js",
  "src/polyfills.ts"
],
```

And finally, make sure to add `src/polyfills` to `files` in your `tsconfig`:

```json{4}
{
  "files": [
    "src/main.ts",
    "src/polyfills.ts"
  ],
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem title="Angular 7-14">

Add the following to your `src/polyfills.ts`:

```ts
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Unhandled Promise rejection console errors

If you see `Unhandled Promise rejection: [message] ; zone: <root> ; ...` errors on console, you can add the following code after you import `zone.js` inside `src/polyfills.ts` file:

```ts{3}
import 'zone.js/dist/zone'; // Included with Angular CLI.

(window as any).Zone['__zone_symbol__ignoreConsoleErrorUncaughtError'] = true;
```

### Typescript Strict Mode Errors

Angular 12+ now turns on typescript strict mode by default. This has known type issues when installing Amplify. You can either work around this by disabling strict mode inside your `tsconfig.json`, or by following the TypeScript strict [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/troubleshooting/strict-mode/q/platform/js/).

### Warning: CommonJS or AMD dependencies

If you see CommonJS or AMD dependencies optimization bailouts warnings on Angular 9+, add the following [content](https://gist.github.com/wlee221/6d98d96740bea6f53327b4db4a432616) to your `angular.json`.
