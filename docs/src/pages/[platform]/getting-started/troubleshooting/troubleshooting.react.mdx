import { Alert, Tabs, TabItem } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

## Webpack 5+

Follow the instructions below to if you are using Webpack 5:

<Alert role="none" variation="info">
*Note:*
Polyfill is only required for Webpack 5+. In this version Node.js global variable shims required by the `aws-amplify` package were removed, which results in the following error message:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
```

Webpack 4 already includes this polyfill.

</Alert>

1. Add
   [node-polyfill-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-polyfill-webpack-plugin)
   as dev dependency:

<Tabs>
<TabItem title="npm">

```shell
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin -D
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem title="yarn">

```shell
yarn add node-polyfill-webpack-plugin -D
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Add the plugin to your `webpack.config.js` plugins list:\_

```js
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(), // Polyfill Node.js globals (e.g. global, process, etc)
  ],
```

## Vite

When working with a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project you must make a few modifications. Please follow the steps below.

**1.** Add the following script tag to the `index.html` file at the bottom of the `<body>` tag.

```html
...
  <script>
    window.global = window;
    window.process = {
      env: { DEBUG: undefined },
    };
    var exports = {};
  </script>
</body>
```

**2.** Update the `vite.config.ts` and add in a resolve object inside the `defineConfig({})` as seen below.

```js
...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
      alias: [
      {
        find: './runtimeConfig',
        replacement: './runtimeConfig.browser',
      },
    ]
  }
})
```

**3.** Update the `tsconfig.json` file and add `skipLibCheck: true` under `compilerOptions`.

```js
...
  "compilerOptions": {
    "skipLibCheck": true,
...
```

## Create React App

When using [Geo components](/connected-components/geo) and Create React App v5, users may experience the following error when rendering the `<MapView>` component in a production build:
```bash
Uncaught ReferenceError: g is not defined
```
The error is related to this [maplibre-gl issue](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/1011#issuecomment-1073112585) and surfaces due to the dropped support for Internet Explorer in `maplibre-gl` v2. To correct this error, you'll need to adjust your browser target for production to exclude Internet Explorer:

**1.** In your `package.json` file of your Create React App, adjust the `browserslist.production` block from:
```json
"browserslist": {
  "production": [
    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not op_mini all"
  ],
  ...
}
```
to the following:
```json
"browserslist": {
  "production": [
    "defaults",
    "not ie 11"
  ],
  ...
}
```
**2.** Rebuild your production application using `npx run build`.

**3.** Run your production build using a tool like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) (`serve -s build`) and verify the `<MapView>` component renders without error.

## Jest

As of v2.15.0 of `@aws-amplify/ui-react` which included the release of Geo components, users of the Jest testing framework may run into the following error when attempting to run tests:

```
window.URL.createObjectURL is not a function
```

Please follow the steps below to resolve this issue.

**1.** Navigate to or create a [Jest setup file](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#setupfilesafterenv-array) for your project.

**2.** Add the following code to polyfill the unrecognized function in your Jest setup file:

```js
if (typeof window.URL.createObjectURL === 'undefined') {
  window.URL.createObjectURL = jest.fn();
}
```

This is a known problem when using the `jsdom` library (a dependency of Jest) with a package that uses an unrecognized function. See [this issue](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/1721).
