**3.** (Optional) If you run into TypeScript errors importing `aws-exports.js`, you may need to update the `tsconfig.json` file with the following config and add a type declaration file:

```json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
  }
...
```

`aws-exports.d.ts` file:

```ts
declare const awsmobile: Record<string, any>
export default awsmobile;
```

> If you are still having issues, please see comments on the following issue for additional [Vite workarounds](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/9639). Note that there is active ongoing work to make these modifications unnecessary.
