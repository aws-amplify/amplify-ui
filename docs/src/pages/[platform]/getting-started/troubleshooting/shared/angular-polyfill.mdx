Angular does not include shims for `global` or `process`. Follow the instructions below to resolve `global` or `process` reference errors.

<Tabs>
<TabItem title="Angular 15+">

First, create `src/polyfills.ts` and add the following:

```ts
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

Then, open your `angular.json` file, and add `src/polyfills.ts` to `polyfills` array(s) in your `angular.json`. These  arrays are located in `projects.<project-name>.architect.<task-name>.options`.

```json{3}
"polyfills": [
  "zone.js",
  "src/polyfills.ts"
],
```

And finally, make sure to add `src/polyfills` to `files` in your `tsconfig`:

```json{4}
{
  "files": [
    "src/main.ts",
    "src/polyfills.ts"
  ],
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem title="Angular 14">

Add the following to your `src/polyfills.ts`:

```ts
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you run into TypeScript errors importing `aws-exports.js`, you may need to add a type declaration file:

`aws-exports.d.ts` file:

```ts
declare const awsmobile: Record<string, any>
export default awsmobile;
```
