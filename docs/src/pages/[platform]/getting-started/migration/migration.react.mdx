### Update and usage

The following breaking changes where introduced in `@aws-amplify/ui-react` major version `3.0`:

#### 1. We removed the built-in icons (Icon360, IconSave, etc).

Replace any icon components in use the react-icons package or other React icon libraries in its place.

```diff
- import { IconSave } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
+ import { MdSave } from 'react-icons/md';
```

Note: We did not remove the [Icon](/react/components/icon) component, which allows customers to easily add SVG icons using the `pathData` prop.

#### 2. We removed `ShareText` export.

This export has been removed and should no longer be used.

### Authenticator breaking changes (1.x to 2.x)

The latest version of the `Authenticator` component has several differences from earlier versions. Here are a few of the major changes that you'll need to look out for.

#### Slots

All the slot locations have changed with the latest version of the `Authenticator`. To get a
sense of the changes please check out the [Headers and Footers](../connected-components/authenticator/customization#headers--footers) section.

#### Form Fields

The latest version of the `Authenticator` has a different format for the `formFields` prop. It also no long accepts
`inputProps` nor `hint`. Instead it's recommended that you use the [Headers and Footers Slots](../connected-components/authenticator/customization#headers--footers) or use the
[Sign Up Fields customization](../connected-components/authenticator/customization#sign-up-fields). For more information on form field customizations
please see the [Form Field Customization](../connected-components/authenticator/customization#form-field-customization) section.

#### CSS Styling

The latest version of the `Authenticator` has a completely different set of CSS variables. Please look over the [Amplify CSS Variables](../connected-components/authenticator/customization#styling) section for more information.
