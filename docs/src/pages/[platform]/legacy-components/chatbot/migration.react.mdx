```diff
- import { ChatBot } from 'aws-amplify-react';
+ import { AmplifyChatbot } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react/legacy';

const App = () => (

+ <AmplifyChatbot botName="yourBotName" />
- <ChatBot botName="yourBotName" />

);
```

If you were using `onComplete` prop previously, you need to use `eventListener` [described above](/ui/interactions/chatbot#listening-to-chat-fulfillment).
