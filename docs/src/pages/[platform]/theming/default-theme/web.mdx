Amplify UI follows a consistent pattern when defining our default tokens for properties such as color, font size, border radius, and more. In addition to the reference here, you can browse our <Link isExternal href="https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/tree/main/packages/ui/src/theme/tokens">default tokens</Link> and their corresponding types on GitHub.

## Explore theme tokens

<Grid 
  templateColumns="repeat(auto-fill, minmax(18rem, 1fr))"
  gap="var(--amplify-space-small)"
  margin="var(--amplify-space-xl) 0">
  <CardLink 
    img={<ColorsIcon />}
    href="/react/theming/default-theme/colors" 
    title="Colors" 
    desc="Tokens that define our default color palette" />

  <CardLink 
    img={<TypographyIcon />}
    href="/react/theming/default-theme/typography" 
    title="Typography" 
    desc="Font families, font sizes, line heights and more" />

  <CardLink 
    img={<SizesIcon />}
    href="/react/theming/default-theme/sizes" 
    title="Sizes" 
    desc="Tokens for spacing, border widths and radii" />
</Grid>

## Referencing default theme tokens

The overall structure of the default theme object gives us a clue as to how to reference each token. If we look at the top level of the object, we can see how the tokens are separated by properties:

```typescript file=../../../../../../packages/ui/src/theme/tokens/index.ts#L25-L41

```

If we use `space` as an example, we'd discover its token definition looks similar to the following (shortened for example):

```json
  space: {
    xxs: {},
    xs: {},
    small: {
      value: "0.75rem"
    }
    medium: {},
    large: {},
  }
```

All of our tokens follow this pattern: a top level namespace that is further defined by a scale, each which has their own unique value. In the case of our space design tokens, that scale is based on a size: small, medium, large, etc. Our [color tokens](/react/theming/default-theme/colors#neutral), on the other hand, are further defined by hue (red, blue, yellow, etc), and then by a numerical scale based on lightness (10-100). 

This structure allows us to reference the small space value as `tokens.space.small` such as in the following example. You can also learn more about [theming](/theming#getting-started) in our getting started guide.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { tokens } = useTheme();
  return <View marginBottom={tokens.space.small}>{children}</Text>;
};
```

The space token definition also gives us an idea of how the CSS custom properties associated with each token are named. Amplify UI uses <Link isExternal href="https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/">StyleDictionary</Link> to generate the associated CSS custom properties for each token. For the small space token, this would be `--amplify-space-small` and you can use it in your component:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <View marginBottom="var(--amplify-space-small)">{children}</Text>;
};
```

Or in your own stylesheet:

```css
.my-component {
  margin-bottom: var(--amplify-space-small);
}
```
