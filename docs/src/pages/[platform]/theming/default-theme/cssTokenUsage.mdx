import { Link } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

The space token definition also gives us an idea of how the CSS custom properties associated with each token are named. Amplify UI uses <Link isExternal href="https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/">StyleDictionary</Link> to generate the associated CSS custom properties for each token. For the small space token, this would be `--amplify-space-small` and you can use it in your stylesheet as:

```css
.my-component {
  margin-bottom: var(--amplify-space-small);
}
```
