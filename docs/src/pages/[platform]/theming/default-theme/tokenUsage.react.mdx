import { Fragment } from '@/components/Fragment';

This structure allows us to reference the small space value as `tokens.space.small` such as in the following example. You can also learn more about [theming](/theming#getting-started) in our getting started guide.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { tokens } = useTheme();
  return <View marginBottom={tokens.space.small}>{children}</Text>;
};
```

<Fragment>{({ platform }) => import(`./cssTokenUsage.mdx`)}</Fragment>
