## Guides

Amplify guides are meant to give you a more in-depth understanding of how to use the Amplify UI components and theming to build out common functionality, end-to-end solutions, and frequently asked for workflows.

## Overview

Guides are organized by topic, but some guides may overlap multiple topics (i.e. Authentication & Theming) to demonstrate how to integrate multiple services together.

Guides may combine the CLI and libraries together in a single tutorial. This is done to provide an end-to-end solution using both the service creation and configuration as well as connecting to and interacting with the service from a client-side application.

## Contributing

If there is a guide or idea that you would like to see implemented that is not listed, open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/issues/new/choose) with the details of the use case and it will be reviewed by our team and considered.

If you have an idea for a guide that you'd like to write yourself, submit a pull request. However, make sure to submit an issue with the details of your idea before you submit your PR, so you can receive guidance and feedback.
