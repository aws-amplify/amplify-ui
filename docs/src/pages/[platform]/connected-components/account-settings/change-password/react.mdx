### Basic Usage

`ChangePassword` has `onSuccess` handler that will be called after successful password change. You may use this callback to run any custom handling, such as navigating route or rendering confirmation messages.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ChangePassword } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

function App() {
  const handleSuccess = () => {
    alert('password is successfully changed!')
  }
  
  return (
    <ChangePassword onSuccess={handleSuccess}/>
  );
}
```

### Custom Validation

You can override the default custom password validator with your own. To do so, you can use the validators prop, which takes an array of ValidatorOptions, which is of type:

```ts
interface ValidatorOptions {
  validationMode: 'onBlur' | 'onChange' | 'onTouched';
  validator: (value: string) => boolean;
  message: string;
}
```

- `onBlur` validates password on every blur event
- `onChange` validates password on every change event
- `onTouched` validates password on first blur, and on every change event after the first blur.

For example, following is a minLength validator that validates on every change:

```js
const minLength = {
  validationMode: 'onChange',
  validator: (password) => password.length >= 4,
  message: 'Password must have length 4 or greater',
};
```

You can pass multiple validators to ConfirmPassword to override the default validator:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ChangePassword } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

function App() {
  const minLength = {
    validationMode: 'onChange',
    validator: (password) => password.length >= 4,
    message: 'Password must have length 4 or greater',
  };
  
  const handleSuccess = () => {
    alert('password is successfully changed!')
  }
  
  return (
    <ChangePassword onSuccess={handleSuccess} validators={[minLength]}/>
  );
}
```

### Component Overrides

You can provide your own UI components to override parts of `ChangePassword`. It supports the following slots:

#### `NewPassword`

Password field for current ("old") password.
