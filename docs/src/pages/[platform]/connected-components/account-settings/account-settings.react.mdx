Account Settings components are a set of standalone components that add [user management](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/manageusers/q/platform/js/) flows to your application with minimal boilerplate.

<Alert variation="warning" role="none">
  Account Settings components require end user to be authenticated. You can use the [`Authenticator`](/connected-components/authenticator) component to add authentication UI to your application.

## Quick Start

<Alert variation="info" role="none">
Next.js 13.4+ introduces [app directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-directory) with the usage of [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components). To use Amplify UI componenents, you must use them inside the Client Component tree by placing `"use client"` at the boundary between your Client and Server component module graph. If you are using it, you need to do some extra setup [here](/react/getting-started/usage/nextjs#connected-components).

### Step 1. Configure Backend

Account settings components work seamlessly with the [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/)
to **automatically** work with your backend.

First, update `@aws-amplify/cli` with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
if you're using a version before `6.4.0`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem title="npm">

```shell
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem title="yarn">

```shell
yarn global add @aws-amplify/cli@latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
