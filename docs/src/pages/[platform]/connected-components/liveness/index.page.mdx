title: Liveness
description: Amplify UI Face Liveness provides a UI component that helps developers deter fraud and scams during face-based identity checks by validating that users are physically present in front of the camera at that moment, and not an imposter spoofing the user's face.
supportedFrameworks: react|android|swift
---

import { Fragment } from '@/components/Fragment';
import { getCustomStaticPath } from '@/utils/getCustomStaticPath';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return getCustomStaticPath(frontmatter.supportedFrameworks);
}

{/*  `getStaticProps` is required to prevent "Error: getStaticPaths was added without a getStaticProps. Without getStaticProps, getStaticPaths does nothing" */}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  return { props: {} }
}

Amplify UI Face Liveness is powered by [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/).

## Quick start

<Fragment>
  {({ platform }) => import(`./prerequisite.${platform}.mdx`)}
</Fragment>

### Step 1. Configure backend

<Fragment>
  {({ platform }) => import(`./quick-start-pull.${platform}.mdx`)}
</Fragment>

Now that you have Amplify Auth setup, follow the steps below to create an inline policy to enable authenticated app users to access Rekognition.

1. Go to AWS IAM console → Roles

2. Select the newly created `unauthRole` for your project (`amplify-<project_name>-<env_name>-<id>-unauthRole`). Note that `unauthRole` should be used if you are not logging in, but if you are using an authenticator with your application, you will need to use `authRole`.

3. Choose **Add Permissions**, then select **Create Inline Policy**, then choose **JSON** and paste the following:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "rekognition:StartFaceLivenessSession",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Choose **Review Policy**

5. Name the policy

6. Choose **Create Policy**

To use Amplify UI Liveness, you must also set up a backend to create the liveness session and retrieve the liveness session results. Follow the [Amazon Rekognition Liveness guide](TODO-ADD-LINK) to set up your backend.

## Best Practices

* End users should complete the Face Liveness check in environments that aren't too dark or too bright and have fairly uniform lighting.
* You should choose a value for the confidence score threshold that reflects the nature of your use case. For use cases with greater security concerns, use a higher threshold.
* You should regularly run human review checks on audit images to check that spoof attacks are mitigated at the confidence threshold you set. 
* You should offer an alternative Face Liveness verification path to your end users if they are photo-sensitive or do not wish to verify their Face Liveness using Rekognition.
