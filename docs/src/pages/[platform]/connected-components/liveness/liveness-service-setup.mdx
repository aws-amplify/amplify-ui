#### Update IAM Role Permissions

Now that you have Amplify Auth setup, follow the steps below to create an inline policy to enable authenticated app users to access Rekognition.

1. Go to AWS IAM console â†’ Roles

2. Select the newly created `unauthRole` for your project (`amplify-<project_name>-<env_name>-<id>-unauthRole` if using the Amplify CLI). Note that `unauthRole` should be used if you are not logging in, but if you are using an authenticator with your application, you will need to use `authRole`.

3. Choose **Add Permissions**, then select **Create Inline Policy**, then choose **JSON** and paste the following:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "rekognition:StartFaceLivenessSession",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Choose **Review Policy**

5. Name the policy

6. Choose **Create Policy**

To use Amplify UI FaceLivenessDetector, you must also set up a backend to create the Face Liveness session and retrieve the session results. Follow the [Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/face-liveness-programming-api.html) to set up your backend.
