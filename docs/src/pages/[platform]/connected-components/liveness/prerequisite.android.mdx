> Prerequisites:
>
> 1. Install and configure the Amplify CLI by following [this guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/android/#configuring-the-amplify-cli).
> 2. An Android application targeting at least Android API level 24 (Android 7.0). For a full example of creating an Android project, please follow the [project setup walkthrough](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/android/#1-create-a-new-project). The Liveness UI component has passed preliminary testing on API level 23 (Android 6.0) with a [workaround](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui-android/commit/99f7bdce8200bc0b43e19fd4c228532726ee627d), but compatibility is not officially supported. If you decide to use Liveness on API level 23, you may encounter issues we can't address.
> 3. A backend that is setup following the [Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/face-liveness-programming-api.html).
