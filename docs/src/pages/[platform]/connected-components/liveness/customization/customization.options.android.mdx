## Challenge Options

Certain liveness challenges have client-side options that you can configure based on your business requirements. For example, you can configure the `FaceMovement` challenge to use either the device's front-facing camera or back-facing camera.

```kotlin
FaceLivenessDetector(
    sessionId = <session ID>,
    region = <region>,
    challengeOptions = ChallengeOptions(
        faceMovement = LivenessChallenge.FaceMovement(camera = Camera.Back)
    ),
    onComplete = {
        Log.i("MyApp", "Face Liveness flow is complete")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        Log.e("MyApp", "Error during Face Liveness flow", error)
    }
)
```
