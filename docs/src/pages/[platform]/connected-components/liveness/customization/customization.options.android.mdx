## Challenge Options

Certain liveness challenges have client-side options that you can configure based on your business requirements. For example, you can configure the `FaceMovement` challenge to use either the device's front-facing camera or back-facing camera.

```kotlin
FaceLivenessDetector(
    sessionId = <session ID>,
    region = <region>,
    challengeOptions = ChallengeOptions(
        faceMovement = LivenessChallenge.FaceMovement(camera = Camera.Back)
    ),
    onComplete = {
        Log.i("MyApp", "Face Liveness flow is complete")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        Log.e("MyApp", "Error during Face Liveness flow", error)
    }
)
```

<Alert variation="info" role="none">
    When the FaceLivenessDetector is rendered, Rekognition will mark the session ID as used and any future usages of the FaceLivenessDector will require a new session ID. So if you want to change which camera is used for the FaceMovement challenge at runtime, you will need to create a new liveness session and pass the new session ID into the FaceLivenessDetector with the new Camera option.
</Alert>

## Video Options

Video options allow you to configure the video stream used during a liveness session. The following options are available:

<ReactPropsTable props={VIDEO_OPTIONS} />

```kotlin
FaceLivenessDetector(
    sessionId = <session ID>,
    region = <region>,
    videoOptions = VideoOptions(videoCodec = VideoCodec.H264),
    onComplete = {
        Log.i("MyApp", "Face Liveness flow is complete")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        Log.e("MyApp", "Error during Face Liveness flow", error)
    }
)
```
