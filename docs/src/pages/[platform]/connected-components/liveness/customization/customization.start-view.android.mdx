FaceLivenessDetector contains an initial (start) view with instructions and information about the Face Liveness check for the end user. By default, the start view is shown before the Face Liveness check. The start view can be disabled, allowing you to provide your own start view before FaceLivenessDetector is displayed in the app:

```kotlin
FaceLivenessDetector(
    sessionId = <session ID>,
    region = <region>,
    disableStartView = true,
    onComplete = {
        Log.i("MyApp", "Face Liveness flow is complete")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        Log.e("MyApp", "Error during Face Liveness flow", error)
    }
)
```
