FaceLivenessDetectorView uses Amplify Auth by default to authorize users to perform the Face Liveness check. [Configure the Amplify Auth category](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/face-liveness-prerequisites.html#face-liveness-prerequisites-amplify) to setup Amplify Auth and add authentication to your backend configuration.

_If you have an existing backend, run `amplify pull` to sync your `amplifyconfiguration.json` with your cloud backend._

You should now have an `amplifyconfiguration.json` file in your project's main directory with your latest backend configuration.
