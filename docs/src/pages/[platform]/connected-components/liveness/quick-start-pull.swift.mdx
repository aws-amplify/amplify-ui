The FaceLivenessDetector component uses Amplify Auth by default to authorize users to perform the liveness check. [Configure the Amplify Auth category](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/ios/#configure-auth-category) to setup Amplify Auth and add authentication to your backend configuration.

_If you have an existing backend, run `amplify pull` to sync your `amplifyconfiguration.json` with your cloud backend._

You should now have an `amplifyconfiguration.json` file in your project's main directory with your latest backend configuration.
