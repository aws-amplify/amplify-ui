The FaceLivenessDetector component uses Amplify Auth by default to authorize users to perform the liveness check. [Configure the Amplify Auth category](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js/#create-authentication-service) to setup Amplify Auth and add authentication to your backend configuration.

_If you have an existing backend, run `amplify pull` to sync your `aws-exports.js` with your cloud backend._

You should now have an `aws-exports.js` file in your `src` directory with your latest backend configuration.
