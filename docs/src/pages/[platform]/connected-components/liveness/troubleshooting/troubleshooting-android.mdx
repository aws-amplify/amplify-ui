### (Android-specific) Compilation errors when creating a backend using a REST API
Errors include: `Package com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.apigateway.annotation does not exist`

These autogenerated files can be safely deleted â€” this should be a one-time fix after `amplify add api` and `amplify push`. To read more, check out: [Configure Amplify API Android documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/restapi/getting-started/q/platform/android/#configure-api)

### (Android-specific) `NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of:`
Potential error: `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Ljava/time/Duration;`
or `Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "java.time.Duration"`

This is caused by not adding desugaring to allow support for Java 8 features, which is required on certain lower Android versions.  To fix:
- Add the following to your `build.gradle`'s `android {}` block:
```groovy
compileOptions {
    // Support for Java 8 features
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```
- Add the following to your **app**'s `build.gradle` dependencies block:
```groovy
dependencies {    
    // Other dependencies...

    // Support for Java 8 features
    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'
}
```

### (Mobile-specific) I am unable to use Cognito. Can I still use the FaceLivenessDetector?

Yes, this use case is supported.  Please select "Custom Credentials Provider" in [Step 1 of the setup](../liveness#step-1-configure-auth).
