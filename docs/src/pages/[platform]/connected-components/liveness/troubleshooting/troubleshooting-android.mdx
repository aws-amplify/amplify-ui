### (Android-specific) Compilation errors when creating a backend using a REST API
Errors include: `Package com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.apigateway.annotation does not exist`

These autogenerated files can be safely deleted â€” this should be a one-time fix after `amplify add api` and `amplify push`. To read more, check out: [Configure Amplify API Android documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/restapi/getting-started/q/platform/android/#configure-api)

### (Mobile-specific) I am unable to use Cognito. Can I still use the FaceLivenessDetector?

Yes, this use case is supported.  Please select "Custom Credentials Provider" in [Step 1 of the setup](../liveness#step-1-configure-auth).
