## Auth

By default, FaceLivenessDetector uses Amplify Auth to authorize users to perform the Face Liveness check. You can use your own credentials provider to retrieve credentials from [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/):

```kotlin
class MyCredentialsProvider : AWSCredentialsProvider<AWSCredentials> {
    override fun fetchAWSCredentials(
        onSuccess: Consumer<AWSCredentials>,
        onError: Consumer<AuthException>
    ) {
        // Fetch the credentials
    }
}
```

```kotlin
FaceLivenessDetector(
    sessionId = <session ID>,
    region = <region>,
    credentialsProvider = MyCredentialsProvider(),
    onComplete = {
        Log.i("MyApp", "Liveness flow is complete")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        Log.e("MyApp", "Error during Liveness flow", error)
    }
)
```
