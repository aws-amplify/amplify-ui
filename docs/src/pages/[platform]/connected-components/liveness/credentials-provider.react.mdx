## Manually Configure Amplify

If you have an existing Cognito setup that you would like to import or if you do not want to go through the full Amplify CLI setup you can manually import a [Cognito Identity Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/identity-pools.html) to use with the FaceLivenessDetector component.

> If you are manually setting up an identity pool in the Cognito console you need to use the v1 Cognito console and visit the [Federated Identities](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/federated) section. When setting up the identity pool ensure that acess to unauthenticated identities is enabled.

When initially configuring Amplify you can pass in the cognito region and an identity pool.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';
import awsexports from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure({
  "aws_cognito_region": "us-east-2", // (required) - Region where Amazon Cognito project was created
  "aws_cognito_identity_pool_id": "us-east-2:xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx", // (required) - the pool region should match the cognito region
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```
