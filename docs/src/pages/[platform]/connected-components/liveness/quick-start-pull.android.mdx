There are four methods to setup the Amazon Cognito resources needed for Amplify Auth. The most common is the Amplify CLI create flow which asks a series of questions and will configure both a User Pool and Identity Pool automatically. The second option is the Amplify CLI import flow which adds an existing Cognito resource into Amplify. The third is to reuse or create a Cognito Identity Pool manually and to add it into your application. Finally the fourth is to pass a credentials provider which obtains the AWS credentials under your control.

FaceLivenessDetector uses Amplify Auth by default to authorize users to perform the Face Liveness check. If you are using Amplify for the first time, follow the instructions for [installing the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/).

#### Set up a new Amplify project

```bash
$ amplify init
? Enter a name for the project androidliveness
? Initialize the project with the above configuration? No
? Enter a name for the environment dev
? Choose your default editor: Android Studio
? Choose the type of app that you're building android
Please tell us about your project
? Where is your Res directory:  app/src/main/res
```

<QuickStart />

#### Push to create the resources

```bash
$ amplify push
✔ Successfully pulled backend environment dev from the cloud.

Current Environment: dev

| Category | Resource name    | Operation | Provider plugin   |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Auth     | androidlive••••• | Create    | awscloudformation | 
```

_If you have an existing backend, run `amplify pull` to sync your `amplifyconfiguration.json` with your cloud backend._

You should now have an `amplifyconfiguration.json` file in your `app/src/main/res/raw` directory with your latest backend configuration.

  <Tabs.Panel value="Existing Cognito Resource">
> If you previously had unmanaged resources that you want to manage with Amplify you can use the CLI to import your Cognito resources.

FaceLivenessDetector uses Amplify Auth by default to authorize users to perform the Face Liveness check. Follow the instructions for [importing existing resources](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/android/#set-up-backend-resources).

<AddAndroid />

  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Self Managed Cognito Resource">
> Use this option if you already have a Cognito identity/user pools that you do not want to import to Amplify, or want to manage Cognito resources yourself or with a 3rd party resource management tool.

If you already have Cognito set up or do not want to use the Amplify CLI to generate Cognito resources, you can follow the documentation in the [existing resources tab](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/android/#set-up-backend-resources).

_If you are manually setting up an identity pool in the Cognito console you can follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-identity-pools.html#create-identity-pool). When setting up the identity pool ensure that access to unauthenticated identities is enabled._

When initially configuring Amplify (assuming you are using no pieces of Amplify other than the FaceLivenessDetector) you can manually create an `amplifyconfiguration.json` file in `app/src/main/res/raw` of this form:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "plugins": {
      "awsCognitoAuthPlugin": {
        "CredentialsProvider": {
          "CognitoIdentity": {
            "Default": {
              "PoolId": "us-east-1:-------------",
              "Region": "us-east-1"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<AddAndroid />

  <Tabs.Panel value="Custom Credentials Provider">
> Use this option if you want more control over the process of obtaining AWS credentials.

By default, FaceLivenessDetector uses Amplify Auth to authorize users to perform the Face Liveness check. You can use your own credentials provider to retrieve credentials from [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) or assume a role with [Amazon STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html), for example:

```kotlin
class MyCredentialsProvider : AWSCredentialsProvider<AWSCredentials> {
    override fun fetchAWSCredentials(
        onSuccess: Consumer<AWSCredentials>,
        onError: Consumer<AuthException>
    ) {
        // Fetch the credentials
        // Note that these credentials must be of type AWSTemporaryCredentials
        // And then call `onSuccess.accept(creds)`
    }
}
```

```kotlin
FaceLivenessDetector(
    sessionId = <session ID>,
    region = <region>,
    credentialsProvider = MyCredentialsProvider(),
    onComplete = {
        Log.i("MyApp", "Liveness flow is complete")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        Log.e("MyApp", "Error during Liveness flow", error)
    }
)
```

<Credentials />

  <Liveness />

  ### Step 2. Install dependencies

  FaceLivenessDetector component is built using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Enable Jetpack Compose by adding the following to the `android` section of your **app**'s `build.gradle` file:

  ```groovy
  compileOptions {
      // Support for Java 8 features
      coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
      sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
      targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
  buildFeatures {
      compose true
  }
  composeOptions {
    kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion '1.2.0'
  }
  ```

  Add the following dependencies to your **app**'s `build.gradle` file and click "Sync Now" when prompted:

  ```groovy
  dependencies {
      // FaceLivenessDetector dependency
      implementation 'com.amplifyframework.ui:liveness:1.2.2'
      
      // Material3 dependency for theming FaceLivenessDetector
      implementation 'androidx.compose.material3:material3:1.1.2'
      
      // Support for Java 8 features
      coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'
  }
  ```

  ### Step 3. Request camera permissions

  FaceLivenessDetector requires access to the camera on the user's device in order to perform the Face Liveness check. Before displaying FaceLivenessDetector, prompt the user to grant camera permission. Please follow these guides for examples of requesting camera permission using either [Android](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting) or [Jetpack Compose](https://google.github.io/accompanist/permissions/).

  ### Step 4. Add FaceLivenessDetector

  <Tabs.Item value="Kotlin">Kotlin</Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item value="Java">Java</Tabs.Item>
  </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Panel value="Kotlin">
      In the `onCreate` of your app's `MainActivity`, add the following code to display FaceLivenessDetector, replacing `<session ID>` with the session ID returned from creating the Face Liveness session and replacing `<region>` with the region you would like to use for the Face Liveness check. The list of supported regions is in the [Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rekognition.html). The code below wraps FaceLivenessDetector in a MaterialTheme that uses the Face Liveness color scheme. More information about theming is in the [Face Liveness Customization page](./liveness/customization).
      <ExampleCode>
      ```kotlin
      setContent {
          MaterialTheme(
              colorScheme = LivenessColorScheme.default()
          ) {
              FaceLivenessDetector(
                  sessionId = <session ID>,
                  region = <region>,
                  onComplete = {
                      Log.i("MyApp", "Face Liveness flow is complete")
                      // The Face Liveness flow is complete and the session
                      // results are ready. Use your backend to retrieve the
                      // results for the Face Liveness session.
                  },
                  onError = { error ->
                      Log.e("MyApp", "Error during Face Liveness flow", error)
                      // An error occurred during the Face Liveness flow, such as
                      // time out or missing the required permissions.
                  }
              )
          }
      }
      ```
      </ExampleCode>
    </Tabs.Panel>
    <Tabs.Panel value="Java">
      FaceLivenessDetector must be created in Kotlin but can still be used in a Java-based app. First, create a new Kotlin file called `MyView` and add the following code to create FaceLivenessDetector, replacing `<session ID>` with the session ID returned from creating the Face Liveness session and replacing `<region>` with the region you would like to use for the Face Liveness check. The list of supported regions is in the [Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rekognition.html). The code below wraps FaceLivenessDetector in a MaterialTheme that uses the Liveness color scheme. More information about theming is in the [Liveness Customization page](./liveness/customization).

                      colorScheme = LivenessColorScheme.default()
                  ) {
                      FaceLivenessDetector(

                          onComplete = {
                              Log.i("MyApp", "Face Liveness flow is complete")
                              // The Face Liveness flow is complete and the

              }
          }
      }
      ```
      </ExampleCode>
      In the `onCreate` of your app's `MainActivity`, add the following code to display FaceLivenessDetector:
      <ExampleCode>
      ```java
      MyView.setViewContent(this);
