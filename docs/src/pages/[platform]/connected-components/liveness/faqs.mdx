## Frequently Asked Questions

The following issues are presented with corresponding troubleshooting steps. Please check them out in case you run into issues like these -- if the remedies don't work, please file an issue in our GitHub repositories.

### Error: Cognito user pool does not allow access to unauthenticated identities

First, make sure you have followed the [prerequisites for setting up Amplify resources](#step-1-configure-auth). Second, you can also go into the Cognito identity pool configured in your Amplify app, edit it and select the checkbox labeled "Enable access to unauthenticated identities" -- then save the changes. Finally, ensure that the configuration file -- `aws-exports.js` on web or `amplifyconfiguration.json` on mobile -- contains the name of the correct identity pool.

### Error: Server error - Session not found 

1. Ensure that the AWS region you are using to create the liveness session in your backend is the same as the one used within your app.
2. Ensure that the session ID returned from the backend when creating the session is the same as the one created on initialization of the Liveness UI. Note: session IDs can only be used once. You must create a new session to allow users to retry the Liveness check.

### Error: AccessDeniedError when calling Rekognition APIs (CreateFaceLivenessSession, etc.)

Full error: `An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the CreateFaceLivenessSession`.

Make sure you are using a supported AWS region. Please refer to [Liveness supported regions](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/face-liveness/#FAQs) documentation.

### No result when GetFaceLivenessSessionResults is called

Ensure that the session ID returned from the backend when creating the session is the same as the one created on initialization of the Liveness UI. Note: session IDs can only be used once. You must create a new session to allow users to retry the Liveness check.
