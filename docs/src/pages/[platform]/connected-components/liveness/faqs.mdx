## Frequently Asked Questions

The following issues are presented with corresponding troubleshooting steps. Please check them out in case you run into issues like these -- if the remedies don't work, please file an issue in our GitHub repositories.

### Error: Cognito user pool does not allow access to unauthenticated identities

First, make sure you have followed the [prerequisites for setting up Amplify resources](#step-1-configure-auth). Second, you can also go into the Cognito identity pool configured in your Amplify app, edit it and select the checkbox labeled "Enable access to unauthenticated identities" -- then save the changes. Finally, if using React, ensure that your `aws-exports.js` file exists and is being imported correctly into your app.

### Error: Server error - Session not found 

1. Ensure that the AWS region you are using to create the liveness session using with your backend is the same as the one used within your app.
2. Ensure that the session ID returned from the backend when creating the session is the same as the one used by the app to start it. Note: session ID's can only be used once. You must create a new session to allow users to retry.

### Error: AccessDeniedError when calling Rekognition APIs (CreateFaceLivenessSession, etc.)

Make sure you are using a supported AWS region. Please refer to [Liveness supported regions](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/face-liveness/#FAQs) documentation.

### No result when GetFaceLivenessSessionResults is called

Ensure that the session ID returned from the backend when creating the session is the same as the one started use by the app. Note: session ID's can only be used once. You must create a new session to allow users to retry.
