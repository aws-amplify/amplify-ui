Next.js 13.4+ introduces [app directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-directory) with the usage of [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components). Amplify UI components are interactive and designed to work on the client side. To use them inside of Server Components you must wrap them in a Client Component with `"use client"`. See [Next.js Connected Component configuration](/react/getting-started/usage/nextjs#connected-components).
