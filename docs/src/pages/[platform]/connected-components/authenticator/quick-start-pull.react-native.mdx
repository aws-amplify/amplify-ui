Now that you have the Amplify CLI installed, you can set up your Amplify project by running `amplify init` in your project's root directory. Then run `amplify add auth` and follow the prompts to add authentication to your backend configuration.

_If you have an existing backend, run `amplify pull` to sync your `aws-exports.js` with your cloud backend._

You should now have an `aws-exports.js` file in your `src/` directory with your latest backend configuration.
