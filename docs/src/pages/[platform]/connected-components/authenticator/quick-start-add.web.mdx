import { Fragment } from '@/components/Fragment';

The quickest way to get started is by wrapping your application with the Authenticator component.
Once an end-user has created an account & signed in, the underlying component is rendered with access to the `user`.

<Fragment>
  {({ platform }) => import(`./quick-start-example.${platform}.mdx`)}
</Fragment>
