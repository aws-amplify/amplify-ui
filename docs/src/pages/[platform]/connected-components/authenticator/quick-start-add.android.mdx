The quickest way to get started is by wrapping your App component (written in Jetpack Compose) with the Authenticator widget.
Once an end-user has created an account & signed in, your content will be displayed.

Add the Authenticator to your app by wrapping your component (represented here by the `@Composable` function `SignedInContent`) with the `Authenticator` component.

```kotlin
import com.amplifyframework.ui.authenticator.rememberAuthenticatorState
import com.amplifyframework.ui.authenticator.ui.Authenticator

class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    setContent {
      Authenticator { state ->
          SignedInContent(state)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
