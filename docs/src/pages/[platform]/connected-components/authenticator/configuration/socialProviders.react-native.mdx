## Social Providers

<Alert role="none" heading="Zero Configuration">

The Authenticator reads directly from your [Amplify configuration](/connected-components/authenticator#step-1-configure-backend) `socialProviders` from `amplify pull`.

</Alert>

Social Provider authentication is supported out of the box, to configure: 
- ensure the required dependencies have been installed in the [React Native Quick Start guide](../../connected-components/authenticator#step-2-install-dependencies)
- configure your provider(s) by following the Amplify JS [Add Social Provider Sign-In guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/react-native/build-a-backend/auth/add-social-provider/)
