## Headers & Footers

The Authenticator has several "slots" that you can customize to add messaging & functionality to meet your app's needs. 

The following example demonstrates how to customize the `Header` and `Container` slots. You may apply the same pattern to the `Footer` slot as well. 

```jsx file=../../../../../../../examples/react-native/src/features/Authenticator/Slots/Example.tsx

```
