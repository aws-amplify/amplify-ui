## Sign Up Field Order

The authenticator allows a custom order of sign up fields on the Sign Up page.

Order is determined by a `signUpForm` `@Compose` block that is passed into the Authenticator state.

In the example below the order will be set as `email`, `username`, `password` and finally `confirm_password`.

```kotlin
val state = rememberAuthenticatorState(
    signUpForm = {
        email()
        username()
        password()
        confirmPassword()
    }
)
```

## Form Field Customization

The Authenticator allows for customization of multiple aspects of the form fields.
The sections below will describe several use cases, on how to modify these fields.

Overall, you can customize the hint or label of any input as described in the
[labels and placeholder](#updating-labels-placeholders-required-fields-and-showing-labels) section.

Additionally, when using a custom Sign Up form as described in [Sign Up Field Order](#sign-up-field-order), you can create fields with custom labels and hints, as well as specify whether the field is required, or pass your own custom validator.

### Updating labels, hints, setting required and adding validators

The following example customizes the Sign Up page by:

- Updating the placeholder with `placeholder`.
- Setting required to true with `isRequired`, which is also the default for this field.
- Updating the label text with `label`.
- Show the label using `labelHidden` set to `false`.

**Note:** On the sign in page the input name is always `username`, regardless of the login mechanism type.
