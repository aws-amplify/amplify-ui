## Form Field Customization

The Authenticator allows for customization of multiple aspects of the form fields.
The sections below will describe several use cases, on how to modify these fields.

### Default international dial code

Default Dial code customization is available via the `defaultDialCode` prop in the `dialCodeOptions` parameter. Changing the `defaultDialCode` will change the default dial code in the phone number field for all forms, including the sign up, sign in, and forgot password forms.

The dial codes are a list of the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes. For example, the United States is `us`, and Canada is `ca`.
A list of the codes can also be found in the `DialCode` class.
