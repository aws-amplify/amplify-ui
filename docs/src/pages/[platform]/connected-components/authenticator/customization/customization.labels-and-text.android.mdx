Using the same techniques as [Internationalization (I18n)](#internationalization-i18n), you can customize the labels (hints) and text of the components. Every string defined by the library is prefixed with `amplify_ui_authenticator_` and strings adhere to a hierarchical naming convention to help identify its usage. All such strings can be found in the `authenticator/src/main/res/values` folder.

For example, here's a string from the library:
```xml
<string name="amplify_ui_authenticator_field_warn_existing">%s already exists</string>
```

You can change this string by overriding the string in your application's default resources:
```xml
<string name="amplify_ui_authenticator_field_warn_existing">Sorry, this is already taken</string>
```
