## Styling

### Theme Provider

You can update the style of the Authenticator by wrapping it with a [ThemeProvider](/react-native/theming). Then create a [theme object](/react-native/theming#theme-structure), with all your font customizations.

```jsx file=../../../../../../../examples/react-native/src/features/Theming/Basic/Example.tsx
```

> If you have TypeScript enabled, all the object keys will be present when creating the [theme object](/react-native/theming#theme-structure). This will help speed up your development time while creating themes.

### Dark mode

Amplify UI comes with a default dark mode implementation 

```jsx file=../../../../../../../examples/react-native/src/features/Theming/DarkMode/Example.tsx
```
