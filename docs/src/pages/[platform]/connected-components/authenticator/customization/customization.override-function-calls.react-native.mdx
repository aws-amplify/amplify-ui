## Override Function Calls

You can override the call to `signUp`, `signIn`, `confirmSignIn`, `confirmSignUp`, `resendSignUpCode`, `forgotPassword` and `forgotPasswordSubmit` functions.
To override a call you must create a new `services` object with an `async` `handle*` function that returns an `aws-amplify` `Auth` promise.
<ForgotPasswordCallout />

The service object must then be passed into the `authenticator` component as a `services` prop. For example, let's imagine you'd like to lowercase the `username` and the `email` attributes during `signUp`.
This would be overriden like so:

<ReactNativeOverrideExample />

Each `handle*` function accepts as input the expected input of its corresponding `Auth` function, allowing you to override the `Auth` function call from within the `handle*` function. Here is a table of each override function name, and the values passed as `input`.
