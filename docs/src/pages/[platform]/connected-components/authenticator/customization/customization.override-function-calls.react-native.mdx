## Override Function Calls

You can override the call to `signUp`, `signIn`, `confirmSignIn`, `confirmSignUp`, `forgotPassword` and `forgotPasswordSubmit` functions. 
To override a call you must create a new `services` object with an `async` `handle*` function that returns an `aws-amplify` `Auth.*` promise.
<ForgotPasswordCallout />
The service object must then be passed into the `authenticator` component as a `services` prop. For example, let's imagine you'd like to lowercase the `username` and the `email` attributes during `signUp`.
This would be overriden like so:

<Alert role="none" variation="warning" heading="Sign Up Auto Sign In">
  When overriding `signUp` you must include the `autoSignIn` key and set `enabled` to true, as show in the example below.
</Alert>

```jsx expoSnack file=../../../../../../../examples/react-native/src/features/Authenticator/OverrideServices/Example.tsx

```

Each `handle*` function accepts as input the expected input of its corresponding `Auth` function, allowing you to override the `Auth` function call from within the `handle*` function. Here is a table of each override function name, and the values passed as `input`.
