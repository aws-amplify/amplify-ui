Run `amplify add auth` to configure how you want the Authenticator and its associated Cognito resources to behave. If you want more details on all of the options available in this step, please check out the Amplify for Swift Library Authentication [getting started page](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/ios/#set-up-backend-resources).

<TerminalCommand command="amplify add auth" />
<TerminalCommand command="amplify push" />

Alternatively, if you have an existing backend, run `amplify pull` to sync your `amplifyconfiguration.json` file:

<TerminalCommand command="amplify pull" />
