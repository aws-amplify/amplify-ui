Amplify UI Storage components allow users to upload and interact with files complete [authentication flows](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/getting-started/q/platform/js/)
to your application with minimal boilerplate.

## Quick start

The Amplify UI Storage components work seamlessly with the [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/)
to **automatically** work with your backend.

First, update `@aws-amplify/cli` with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
if you're using a version before `6.4.0`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem title="npm">

```shell
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem title="yarn">

```shell
yarn global add @aws-amplify/cli@latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



Now that you have the Amplify CLI installed, you can set up your Amplify project by running `amplify init` in your project's root directory. 
<Alert role="none" variation="info" heading="File Uploader Auth">
  If you are looking to use the File Uploader component, you must also setup auth. Run `amplify add auth` after initilizing your project.
</Alert>

Then run `amplify add storage` and follow the prompts to add storage to your backend configuration.

_If you have an existing backend, run `amplify pull` to sync your `aws-exports.js` with your cloud backend._

You should now have an `aws-exports.js` file in your `src/` directory with your latest backend configuration.

After setting up Amplify make sure to install the Amplify libraries.
