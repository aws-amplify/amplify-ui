## Overview

Storage Browser for Amazon S3 is an open source component that you can add to your web applications to provide your end users with a simple, graphical interface to work with data stored in Amazon S3. With Storage Browser for S3, you can provide authorized end users access to easily browse, download, upload, copy, and delete data in S3 directly from your own applications.

End users work with S3 _locations_ within the Storage Browser interface. _Locations_ are S3 buckets or prefixes that you authorize end users to access using Amazon S3 Access Grants or Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, depending on your use case. When the Storage Browser component is first rendered, it will show the LocationsView which displays only the locations you have granted them access to. Once an end user has selected a location, they can browse the S3 bucket or prefix, and all the data contained further down the S3 resource path, but they cannot browse buckets or prefixes higher up the S3 resource path.

## Setup and Authentication

The `StorageBrowser` component is the first Amplify UI component to support different authentication methods other than Amplify Auth, which is based on Amazon Cognito and IAM policies. 

In order to show S3 locations and their contents to end users, you first need to set up your preferred authentication and authorization methods. There are 3 ways you can set up authentication/authorization with the storage browser component:


1. **Amplify auth:** If you are already using Amplify then this option lets you get started the fastest. It uses Amazon Cognito for authentication and IAM policies for authorization and access. And by using Amplify Gen 2, the access rules for users and groups can be customized. This option is ideal for use cases when you want to connect your customers and third-party partners to your data in S3.
2. **AWS IAM Identity Center and S3 Access Grants:** We recommend this option if you want to grant access on a per-S3-prefix basis to both IAM principals and directly to users or groups from your corporate directory. With S3 Access Grants capabilities, applications can request data from Amazon S3 on behalf of the current authenticated user. This means your applications no longer need to first map the user to an IAM principal. And when you use S3 Access Grants with IAM Identity Center trusted identity propagation, each AWS CloudTrail data event for S3 references the end user identity that accessed your data. This option is ideal for use cases when you want to connect your entire workforce with your data in S3.
3. **Customer managed auth:** We recommend this option if you have your own identity and authorization service for authenticating and authorizing users in your application. To use this option, you will need to provide the list of S3 locations to display to the user and a mechanism for fetching scoped AWS STS tokens for each location.

The `StorageBrowser` component signs all requests made to Amazon S3 based on the temporary credentials generated by one of the authorization modes above. With Ampify Auth, this is handled automatically for you based on your backed resource definitions. With IAM Identity Center and S3 Access Grants, you are responsible for setting up IAM Identity Center and S3 Access Grants and configuring them to work with your application. With custom auth, you are responsible for configuring your application to vend STS tokens to the StorageBrowser component to authorize end users' requests during their session.

### Bucket CORS

The `StorageBrowser` component is a client-side component that makes authorized requests to S3 APIs from the browser. If you are not using Amplify to provision your S3 buckets, you will need to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies on the buckets you want available in the `StorageBrowser`  component. 

<Example>
<ExampleCode>
```json
[
  {
    "ID": "S3CORSRuleId1",
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "*"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "HEAD",
      "PUT",
      "POST",
      "DELETE"
    ],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "last-modified",
      "content-type",
      "content-length",
      "etag",
      "x-amz-version-id",
      "x-amz-request-id",
      "x-amz-id-2",
      "x-amz-cf-id",
      "x-amz-storage-class",
      "date",
      "access-control-expose-headers"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```
</ExampleCode>
</Example>

<Message colorTheme="info" variation='filled' heading="Security best practice">
To reinforce security on your S3 bucket, we recommend that you define the AllowedOrigins element with request restrictions. You can restrict bucket requests so that only the application URL that you want to accept requests from are allowed.
</Message>

### Amplify Auth

Make sure you have an Amplify Gen2 project started, by following the [getting started guides](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/quickstart/). Then create an S3 bucket with access rules by [defining a storage resource and adding authorization rules](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/storage/authorization/):

<Example>
<ExampleCode>

```ts
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'public/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read']),
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'protected/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']),
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'private/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ]
  })
});
```
</ExampleCode>
</Example>

The access rules defined in `defineStorage` are treated as _locations_, which is described in the Overview. Therefore, users will have access to all of the S3 resource paths you have authorized them to access and can start browsing the S3 buckets or prefixes specified by these paths. 

Then in your React code, call `Amplify.configure()` with your `amplify_outputs.json`. If you have some access rules that require a logged in user, like `allow.authenticated`, you can wrap your page in the [`<Authenticator>`](/react/connected-components/authenticator) component to easily add authentication flows to your app. 

<Example>
<ExampleCode>
```ts
import {
  createAmplifyAuthAdapter,
  createStorageBrowser,
} from '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage/browser';
import "@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage/styles.css";

import config from './amplify_outputs.json';

// note: `Amplify.configure` must be run before call to `createAmplifyAuthAdapter`
Amplify.configure(config);

export const { StorageBrowser } = createStorageBrowser({
  config: createAmplifyAuthAdapter(),
});
```
</ExampleCode>
</Example>

### IAM Identity Center and S3 Access Grants

To use this authorization method, you first have to configure an IAM Identity Center and set up permission grants for your users and groups in S3 Access Grants. Then, you connect your application to Identity Center and configure your application to exchange an identity token from your external Identity Provider with one from Identity Center. Afterwards, you configure your application to provide the Identity Center token to Storage Browser when a user opens the page in your application to access your data in S3. To learn more, visit the [S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-browser.html).

<Example>
<ExampleCode>
```ts
import {
    createManagedAuthAdapter,
    createStorageBrowser,
} from '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage/browser';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage/styles.css';

export const { StorageBrowser } = createStorageBrowser({
   config: createManagedAuthAdapter({
    credentialsProvider: async (options?: { forceRefresh?: boolean }) => {
      // return your credentials object
      return {
        credentials: {
          accessKeyId: 'my-access-key-id',
          secretAccessKey: 'my-secret-access-key',
          sessionToken: 'my-session-token',
          expiration: new Date(),
        },
      }
    },
    // AWS `region` and `accountId` of the S3 Access Grants Instance.
    region: '',
    accountId: '',
    // call `onAuthStateChange` when end user auth state changes 
    // to clear sensitive data from the `StorageBrowser` state
    registerAuthListener: (onAuthStateChange) => {},
  })
});
```
</ExampleCode>
</Example>

### Customer managed auth

To use your own identity and authorization service with Storage Browser, you will need to provide the temporary credentials used to sign the requests your end users are making to S3 through the `StorageBrowser` component.

<Example>
<ExampleCode>
```ts
import { createStorageBrowser } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage/browser';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage/styles.css';

export const { StorageBrowser } = createStorageBrowser({
   config: {
    // Default AWS `region` and `accountId` of the S3 buckets.
    region: 'XXX',
    accountId: 'XXXXXX',
    listLocations: async (input = {}) => {
      const { nextToken, pageSize } = input;
      return {
        items: [
          {
            bucket: '[bucket name]',
            prefix: '', // empty path means bucket root
            id: 'XXXXXXX', // unique identifier 
            type: 'BUCKET',
            permissions: ['delete', 'get', 'list', 'write'],
          },
          {
            bucket: '[bucket name]',
            prefix: 'some/path',
            id: 'XXXXXXX', // unique identifier 
            type: 'PREFIX',
            permissions: ['delete', 'get', 'list', 'write'],
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    getLocationCredentials: async ({ scope, permission }) => {
      // get credentials for specified scope and permission
      return {
        credentials: {
          accessKeyId: '',
          secretAccessKey: '',
          sessionToken: '',
          expiration: new Date(),
        }
      }
    },
    registerAuthListener: (onStateChange) => {

    }
  },
})
```
</ExampleCode>
</Example>

You will also need to provide these config values to `createStorageBrowser`: 

<Example>
<ExampleCode>
```ts
interface Config {
  accountId?: string;
  customEndpoint?: string;
  getLocationCredentials: GetLocationCredentials;
  listLocations: ListLocations;
  registerAuthListener: RegisterAuthListener;
  region: string;
}
```
</ExampleCode>
</Example>

## Customization

### Theming

The `StorageBrowser` component is built on Amplify UI components so if you already have an Amplify UI theme it will just work with the Storage Browser out of the box. The components used in the Storage Browser are: [`<Button>`](/react/components/button), [`<Breadcrumbs>`](/react/components/breadcrumbs), [`<Menu>`](/react/components/menu), [`<Pagination>`](/react/components/pagination), [`<SearchField>`](/react/components/searchfield), [`<Checkbox>`](/react/components/checkboxfield), [`<TextField>`](/react/components/textfield), and [`<Message>`](/react/components/message).

#### Theme object

You can use the `createTheme()` function to theme the `StorageBrowser` component

<Example>
  <Theming />
  <ExampleCode>
    ```jsx file=./examples/Theming.tsx
    ```
  </ExampleCode>
</Example>




#### CSS

One way to theme the Storage Browser component is to use plain CSS. Amplify UI components use CSS classnames and CSS variables, so you can just write CSS to style the Storage Browser.


### Icons

You can use the `<IconsProvider>` to customize the icons used in the `StorageBrowser` component. 

<Example>
  <Icons />
  <ExampleCode>
    ```jsx file=./examples/Icons.tsx
    ```
  </ExampleCode>
</Example>

### Display Text

You can customize all of the text (except S3 data like keys and bucket names) used in Storage Browser by using the `displayText` prop which is a nested object organized by view. You don't need to provide an entire object; the `StorageBrowser` component will merge your input with the default strings. Some texts are plain strings and others are are functions that take some input, like a date, and return a string. 

<Example>
  <DisplayText />
  <ExampleCode>
    ```jsx file=./examples/DisplayText.tsx
    ```
  </ExampleCode>
</Example>

All of the display texts are listed below with their default values and types.

<Accordion items={DISPLAY_TEXT.map(({key,props}) => {
  return {
    trigger: key,
    value: key,
    content: <ReactPropsTable props={props} />
  }
})}
/>

#### Internationalization

You can also use the `displayText` prop to also support different languages. You can use an open source library like i18next, react-intl, or make your own:

<Example>
  <I18n />
  <ExampleCode>
    ```jsx file=./examples/i18n.tsx
    ```
  </ExampleCode>
</Example>

### Composition

If you wanted to rearrange some of the components in any of the views without wanting to rebuild the entire view yourself, you can use the composable components of the view(s) you wish to customize. You will first need to use the `useView('[view name]')` hook and pass the return to the `<StorageBrowser.[view name].Provider>` and then the children of the provider can be the composed sub-components. 

Below you wll find examples of how to compose each view. See [View reference](#view-reference) for a list of components that can be composed in each view.

<Example>
  <Composed />
  <Tabs.Container defaultValue="StorageBrowser">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Item value="StorageBrowser">StorageBrowser</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="Locations">Locations</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="LocationDetail">Location Detail</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="Upload">Upload</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="Copy">Copy</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="CreateFolder">CreateFolder</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="Delete">Delete</Tabs.Item>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Panel value="StorageBrowser">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```tsx file=./examples/Composed.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Locations">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```tsx file=./examples/ComposedLocationsView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="LocationDetail">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```tsx file=./examples/ComposedLocationDetailView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="CreateFolder">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```jsx file=./examples/ComposedCreateFolderView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Upload">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```jsx file=./examples/ComposedUploadView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Copy">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```jsx file=./examples/ComposedCopyView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Delete">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```jsx file=./examples/ComposedDeleteView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
</Tabs.Container>
</Example>




### Custom UI

The `createStorageBrowser` function returns a `useView()` hook that lets you use the Storage Browser's internal state and event handlers to build your own UI on top the Storage Browser functionality.

The `useView()` hook takes a single argument which is the name of the view you want to get the UI state and event handlers for. The available views are `Locations`, `LocationDetails`, `Copy`, `Upload`, `Delete`, and `CreateFolder`. The return value of the hook will have all the necessary internal state and event handlers required to build that view. In fact, the Storage Browser component itself uses the `useView()` to manage its state, so you can build the UI exactly how we do!

<Example>
  <Custom />
<Tabs.Container defaultValue="StorageBrowser">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Item value="StorageBrowser">StorageBrowser</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="Locations">Locations</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="Upload">Upload</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="Copy">Copy</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="CreateFolder">CreateFolder</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item value="Delete">Delete</Tabs.Item>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Panel value="StorageBrowser">
    <ExampleCode>
    ```jsx file=./examples/Custom.tsx
    ```
  </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Locations">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```tsx file=./examples/CustomLocationsView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Copy">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```jsx file=./examples/CustomCopyView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="CreateFolder">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```jsx file=./examples/CustomCreateFolderView.tsx
        ```
        </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Upload">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```jsx file=./examples/CustomUploadView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="Delete">
      <ExampleCode>
        ```jsx file=./examples/CustomDeleteView.tsx
        ```
      </ExampleCode>
  </Tabs.Panel>
</Tabs.Container>
</Example>


### Customize actions

The Storage Browser uses actions to handle data transfer with backend services, e.g. S3. You can set the `actions` config to modify or replace default actions, or adding custom actions. The `actions` config accepts 2 categories of actions: `default` and `custom`. 

#### Extend default actions

The `default` actions are invoked by associated default UI views to handle data transfer with S3. They are `listLocationItems`, `copy`, `createFolder`, `delete`, `download`, `upload`.

You can use `defaultActionConfigs` to access the default implementation of these actions. Below is an example to instrument the default upload action to count the files being uploaded.

<Example>
<ExampleCode>
```ts
import { createStorageBrowser, defaultActionConfigs } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage/browser';

const { StorageBrowser } = createStorageBrowser({
  actions: {
    default: {
      upload: {
        ...defaultActionConfigs.upload,
        handler: ({ config, data, options }) =>
          defaultActionConfigs.upload.handler({
            config,
            data,
            options: {
              ...options,
              onSuccess: (...input) => {
                options?.onSuccess?.(...input);
                fileUploadCounter.add(1); // Your custom counter metrics.
              },
              onError: (data, message, error) => {
                options?.onError?.(data, message, error);
                fileUploadError.recordError(error); // Your custom error metrics.
              },
            },
          }),
      }
    }
  }
});
```
</ExampleCode>
</Example>

#### New custom actions

You can set the `custom` actions to add entirely new actions to the StorageBrowser component to be used in the custom UI view. 

The `createStorageBrowser` function returns a `useAction` hook that allows you to call the custom or default action in your custom UI view. There are 2 ways to use `useActions`:
* If your action needs to be executed concurrently on a list of selected files, like example below. You invoke the hook by supplying the inputs array in `items`, like:
 `const [ { tasks }, handleAction ] = useAction('[my action name]', { items: ['input1', 'input2'] });`. Then call `handleAction()` to invoke concurrent execution of action and access the execution status of eac task via `tasks`.
* If your action is only suppose to run with a given input. You invoke the hook with the action name only, like `const [{ task }, handleAction] = useAction('[my action name]');`. Then call `handleAction(input)` to invoke the action.

Below is an example of a custom action that launches a custom action to generate a temporary presigned URL to selected objects.

<Example>
<GenerateUrlViewComposed />
<Tabs.Container defaultValue="generateUrlHandler">
<Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Item value="StorageBrowser">StorageBrowser</Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item value="generateUrlHandler">generateUrl</Tabs.Item>
</Tabs.List>
<Tabs.Panel value="StorageBrowser">
<ExampleCode>
```jsx file=./examples/GenerateUrlViewComposed.tsx
```
</ExampleCode>
</Tabs.Panel>
<Tabs.Panel value="generateUrlHandler">
  <ExampleCode>
```ts
import { S3, GetObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { getSignedUrl } from '@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner';

import { ActionHandler } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage/browser';

type GenerateLink = ActionHandler<
  { duration: number; fileKey: string },
  { link: string }
>;

export const generateUrlHandler: GenerateLink = ({ data, config, options }) => {
  const asyncExecution = async () => {
    try {
      const s3 = new S3({
        region: config.region,
        credentials: (await config.credentials()).credentials,
      });
      const command = new GetObjectCommand({
        Bucket: config.bucket,
        Key: data.key,
      });
      const url = await getSignedUrl(s3, command, {
        expiresIn: data.duration * 60,
      });
      const result = {
        status: 'COMPLETE' as const,
        value: { link: url },
      };
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      const message = 'Unable to generate link';
      return {
        status: 'FAILED' as const,
        message,
        error,
      };
    }
  };

  return { result: asyncExecution() };
};
```
  </ExampleCode>
</Tabs.Panel>
</Tabs.Container>
</Example>

<Message colorTheme="info" variation='filled' heading="Security best practice">
This example is for demonstration purpose only. In reality the expiration of a presigned URL is associated with the the expiry of AWS auth session signing the URL. You may need to assume a IAM role with longer-expiry session to sign a URL.
